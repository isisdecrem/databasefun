	= Detect objects and faces (https://docs.opencv.org)
- Undo / Redo
	= Create a stack variable  
	= Everytime we do an operation we push the image data to the our stack  
	= When we undo we pop the image data out of the stack  
	= Add the last element in the stack's image data to the canvas  
	= When we redo we reapply the image data that we popped out and readd it to the stack
